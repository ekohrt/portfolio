# Ethan Kohrt - Budget Gordon Ramsay Bot
  
The bot is an angry chef who gives you nonsensical recipe instructions and berates you if you get distracted. Like Gordon Ramsay.  
  
If the user says hello/hi/hey/yo/howdy, the bot introduces itself as Gordon "The spicy avacado" Ramsay, or any other nickname made from a random adjective and ingredient.  
  
Then the bot starts giving you nonsensical recipe instructions, made from filling in common recipe phrases with random cooking verbs and nouns. You can go to the next instruction by clicking the "Next" button, or by saying "yes chef!"  
  
However, if the user says anything except "yes chef" the bot will insult your cooking abilities by generating a cooking-themed insult. Just like the real Gordon Ramsay!
